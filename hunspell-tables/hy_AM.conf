# Attention: using the simulated Armenian keyboard from m17n
# for Armenian is probably not a good idea. Because the 0123456789
# keys need to be valid input keys then (for example '2' is transliterated to
# 'Õ±'. But the number keys are used
# to select one of the suggested candidates.
# 
# But actually it seems that one cannot easily type the numbers 123456789
# with the real Armenian keyboard either, i.e. apparently one can
# select one off the suggested candidates only with the arrow keys
# followed by space.
