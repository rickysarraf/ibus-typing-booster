# If a character of one of these categories is typed and no
# transliteration is used, the preëdit can be committed immediately.
# However, if transliteration is used, we may need to handle a
# punctuation or symbol character. For example, “.c” is
# transliterated to “ċ” in the “t-latn-pre” transliteration
# method, therefore we cannot just pass it through, we have to add
# it to the input and see what comes next.
#
# This list is very similar to the list of categories to strip from
# tokens. But I removed the 'Pd' (Punctuation, Dash) category because
# of words like “up-to-date”. Triggering a commit at the first “-”
# prevents learning such words from user input. I.e. the list of
# categories to trigger immediate commit should contain only categories
# which are very unlikely to appear as parts of words.
